# Leap Year Determination

This project contains a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year.

## Function Description

The function takes a single integer input representing a year and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year.

### Leap Year Rules

- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
- However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the function into your project.
3. Call the function with the year you want to check.








## Power Function

This project also includes a function to calculate the power of a number.

### Function Description

The power function takes two integer inputs: the base and the exponent. It returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the power function into your project.
3. Call the function with the base and exponent you want to calculate.


### Notes

- The function uses a recursive algorithm to compute the power.
- Ensure that the exponent is a non-negative integer.
