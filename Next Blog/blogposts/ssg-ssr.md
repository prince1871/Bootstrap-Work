# Static Site Generation (SSG) vs. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

## Introduction

When building modern web applications, developers often face the choice between Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Both approaches have their own advantages and use cases. This document will explore the differences, benefits, and scenarios where each method is most appropriate.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

### What is SSG?

Static Site Generation is a method where HTML pages are generated at build time. These pages are pre-rendered and served to the client as static files.

### Benefits of SSG

- **Performance**: Since the pages are pre-rendered, they can be served quickly from a CDN.
- **Scalability**: Static files can be easily cached and distributed, making it easy to handle high traffic.
- **Security**: With no server-side processing, the attack surface is reduced.

### Use Cases for SSG

- Blogs and personal websites
- Documentation sites
- Marketing pages

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### What is SSR?

Server-Side Rendering is a method where HTML pages are generated on the server for each request. This means the server processes the request and sends a fully rendered page to the client.

### Benefits of SSR

- **SEO**: Since the content is rendered on the server, search engines can easily crawl and index the pages.
- **Dynamic Content**: Suitable for applications that require real-time data fetching and rendering.
- **Initial Load Time**: Faster initial load time for users, as the HTML is fully rendered on the server.

### Use Cases for SSR

- E-commerce sites
- News websites
- Applications requiring real-time data

## Conclusion

Choosing between SSG and SSR depends on the specific needs of your project. SSG is ideal for static content that doesn't change often, while SSR is better suited for dynamic content that requires frequent updates. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach will help you make an informed decision for your web application.
